<h1><center>Where I Think Immersive Reality is Going</center></h1>

<p>VR, AR and XR alike have all made huge developments in the last 5 to 10 years. Due to this, I believe that the extent to which these technologies could develop further is endless. 

<br>When it comes to VR, it is possibly the most highly developed of the three digital tools. I think VR could bring huge innovation in the area of training and development. This is especially relevant in professions such as medicine where students can be trained in practical elements without human volunteers. VR can simulate any situation and make it seem as if you are physically there. This could train students to be highly capable in every situation. 
<br>AR is less highly advanced then VR. With the use of the camera, it is less physically immersive. But I think AR could be used greatly in areas such as design and architecture. It could be used to scan surroundings and add things to the environment like potential buildings or items of furniture in a room. 

<br>XR is an umbrella of all types of immersive technology and I feel this could be the way to have users be fully immersed in a ‘digital world’ such as with gaming. But I do feel it is difficult to envision now how this could advance. The possibilities are vast. </p>
