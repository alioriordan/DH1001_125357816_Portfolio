<h1> <center> My Response to Google has a Striking History of Bias Against Black Girls </center></h1>

<p> Reading the strikingly titled article Google Has a Striking History of Bias Against Black Girls by  Safiya Noble was an eye opening experience. It was fascinating to see how a common bias has been carried from history into the digital age. This is a bias against people of colour and in particular an objectification of black women. The concept of big tech companies such as google being able to prioritise certain search results was concerning, especially in the context of promoting big companies over small businesses in order to make a larger profit. It was upsetting to read how this has been applied to underscore womens lack of status in society and to reapply age old stereotypes. Noble focused on the explicit nature of search results in relation to black women and girls and it was shocking to see the reality of this problem. I was stunned to read about the politics of information technology and computer programming and how companies are less likely to hire black women into those roles. After reading this article, I have come to realise that there is change needed to be made in the digital industry and large companies need to be held accountable for obvious harmful biases. </p>
