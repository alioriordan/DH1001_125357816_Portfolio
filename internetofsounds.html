<h1><center>Where I Think the Internet of Sound is Going</center></h1>

<p> After learning about the Internet of Things (IoT) and the Internet of Sound, I am fascinated by both the positive and negative implications of the possible developments to come. It is concerning that the internet of sound could allow others to listen to what is coming from your device, this could make for easier hacking with damaging effects. But the Internet of sound could also allow for easier contactless payment with audio signals, I find this intriguing. </p>
