<h1> <center> My Response to Anatomy of an AI system </center></h1>

<p>This article piqued my interest from the first section. I found it disturbing how the article described that a single AI system goes through three processes that seem almost reserved for humans: birth, life and death. Following on from this concept of AI having a life cycle, it is also described as being Planetary throughout the article and this is distressingly accurate to the vast features that AI currently possesses. I was fascinated as the article went on to compare the hollowing of our earths materials and resources to how AI privatises information and data. Using the example of an Alexa, this article was definitely eye opening to the extent that AI is involved in our daily lives even without us realising it. We are using huge amounts of energy and most likely ruining our environment in a way that seems almost irrelevant until put in perspective: AI. </p>
