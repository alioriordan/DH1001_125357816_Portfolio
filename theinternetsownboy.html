<h1><center>My Response to: The Internet's Own Boy</center></h1>
<p>Prior to watching The Internets Own Boy I had no ideas on the concept of information being open for the public to access. It upset me to see the development of a very intelligent Aaron Swartz, an individual who seemed to have the capabilities to make great change in the world, and to know that he came upon so much resistance from the government. It shifted my view on accessing information, making me notice this moral dilemma that I had previously overlooked. 
    I do believe now that we do not have any control over the publishing of information, that it is all controlled by those in higher positions of power. But I do not believe this is correct in a moral way. I believe that information should be publicly available and that Aaron Swartzs struggle should be taken as an example of how one person can make a change in the world.</p>
