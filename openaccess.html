<h1><center>Open Access Response</center></h1>

<p>After reading Istvan Revs article, I realised how complex the issue of public access versus privacy really is. His article contained three main points, that open access and privacy are in a constant battle, that the meaning of archival documents has changed over time and that technology has introduced new ethical risks. Rev describes that privacy is deeply contextual and dependant. Archives are balancing on a very delicate ethical line between open access and privacy and they must still keep the integrity of these documents. I found that I am conflicted on the issue of open access, I think there is definitely a problem with companies privatising information that should be openly available but I also think privacy and the preservation or our history should be taken into account. </p>
