<h1><center>My Respose to: A Contract for the Web</center></h1>   

<p>After watching Eli Parisers TED talk and reading the principles for trust, strong community with respect civil discourse and human dignity on a contract for the web, I found that principle 8 and principle 5 and interlinked by one common thread: inclusivity. Principle 5 detailed the need for consumers to remain in control of their own rights and for this access to equally available. It described how this relies on companies being held accountable for their wrongs when it comes to collecting data. 
        
Principle 8 detailed the need for an inclusive web, having the best practices when it comes to civil discourse and educating the next generation on this. It stands for equality for excluded groups. This is very similar to principle 5 due to the need for equality and inclusivity, both within the web and among consumers. I think this is a very important link to be made, how information should be equally available to every group no matter the view society takes of them. </p>
